<h2>Background:</h2>
<h2>Why we make spa kits?</h2>
<p class="lead">
Spa therapy (also known as a bath or hydrotherapy) has been used for centuries and have known benefits for many common aches and pains according to several studies (Guillemin et al. 1994; Tubergen and Linden 2002; Sukenik et al. 2002). Todayâ€™s average spa visit ranges from $30+ depending on the service (i.e. massage, steam rooms, saunas, mud baths, etc.) and/or length of time (average 30 minute minimum). This can be on the pricey side and not a lot of people who would greatly benefit from those products/services can actually afford them. Taylor Made Unique places beneficial items into each spa kit to help everyday working people relax after a long day, by turning their bathroom into an oasis.</p>
